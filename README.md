## Lessons Learned


What did you learn while building this project?

This is my first app that I built outside of the courses that I have taken. I learned how to use: React Hooks, React-Router, Supabase API, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn.

Why did you want to build this project?

I wanted to build this because of the current UI that I use in my special education job. Teacher in most districts use what is called SEIS which is an integration system that communicates with other schools about special education students and data. It also houses documents to write on and update throughout the year. Building a SEIS clone is certainly a feat for one person so I did not come into this project planning to build the entire system. My main interest was to build a clone that has cleaner UI and ideas to how another integration system would be. Ideas such as: darker ui, caseload upon loading, simpler information look up. The current SEIS clone is cluttered with much information and a case manager is only interested in gaining access to student details to work on.

What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

The biggest challenge for me was going to understand User Authentication and connecting my application to a back-end API and understanding how to use tables. I went to Youtube and watched a video tutorial on how to set up and do User Authentication. I also used AI such as ChatGPT and Gemini to help me understand along the way the code that was breaking and suggesting solutions.
